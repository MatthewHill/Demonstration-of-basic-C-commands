Explain in detail how APIs (getpid() and fprintf) works in a separate file

getpid() : returns the process ID of the calling process.  In the form of pid_t

fprintf() : puts an output into a named output stream.  fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed"); is used in this program so that "Fork Failed" will be printed to stderr rather than standard output stream like printf().
